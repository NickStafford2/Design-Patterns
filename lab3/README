Templated List

The Collection class defined in Collection.h uses templates to
implement the linked list defined in the list.h header file. The
Collection class has several functions to make manipulating linked
lists easier for the client. list.h is templated as well. both
collection as well as list accept any type as input.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Collection class offers several functions for clients to use:

addItem(): takes an item as the argument and adds it to the
collection, does not check for duplicates.

removeItem(): takes an item as the argument and removes all instances
of this item from the collection.

lastItem(): returns the last item added to the collection.

printCollection(): prints all items in the collection. The printout
does not have to be in order.

bool equal(const Collection&, const Collection&) : compares two
collections for equality.
