Lab 7 implements a hashmap

To test use the command make with no parameters
   $ make

To create all test executables use the command
   $ make tests
This creates two executables, oldTests and newTests. both use the same hashmap.hheader file
     - oldTests executes the default tests provided by the assignment
     - newTests executes my tests which are more complete.


To test with a large file as input, change the data source in
hashmap.cpp from "data1.txt" to "data2.txt"
